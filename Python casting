Python casting :-
           Type casting is converting one data type in to another data type is knowns as type casting .
int() - constructs an integer number from an integer literal, a float literal (by removing all decimals), or a string literal (providing the string represents a whole number)
float() - constructs a float number from an integer literal, a float literal or a string literal (providing the string represents a float or an integer)
str() - constructs a string from a wide variety of data types, including strings, integer literals and float literals.

for example program :-
       a=56
       b=7.98
       c="sudhar"
       print(int(b))
       print(char(a))
       print(str(c))
       print(float(b))
       sum = a+b
       print("sum",sum) 
output :-
7
"56"
'sudhar'
7.9
sum 63.89
